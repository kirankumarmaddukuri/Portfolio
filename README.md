header with my name, photo, and social media links. The "About Me" section provides
an introduction, highlighting my education and skills in C, C++, HTML, CSS, Java,
and Python. The "My Skills" section displays my technical proficiencies, while the
"My Projects" section showcases key projects with descriptions and GitHub links.
Finally, the "Contact" section includes a form and additional contact information,
making it easy for visitors to reach out. This project demonstrates my web
development skills and serves as an interactive resume.
